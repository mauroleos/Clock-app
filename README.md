# Summary
After learning the basics of Python and Javascript I sought out a mentor to help me expand and refine my abilites. One of the first steps I took was to build this digital clock app using pure Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This app was special to me because it was the first app I finished on own from start-to-finish. I really enjoyed working on this app!
